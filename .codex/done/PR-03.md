# PR-03: Implement `capabilities()` export for ALL providers (parity completion)

## Goal
Finish the migration where only a subset of capabilities were copied. Every provider must export a complete `capabilities()` response so the host can plan generically.

## Changes
For each provider component (Slack/Teams/Telegram/Webchat/Webex/WhatsApp/etc. as applicable):
- Implement exported function:
  - `capabilities() -> ProviderCapabilitiesV1` (or JSON string if ABI currently uses string)
- Populate real limits:
  - max text length
  - max payload bytes
  - buttons/actions limits
  - thread/reply support
  - markdown/html support
  - images/attachments support
- Add conformance tests:
  - capabilities must deserialize and validate
  - `version == "v1"`
  - required fields present

## Acceptance criteria
- Every provider component returns capabilities successfully
- Conformance tests cover all components
- CI stays green

## Notes
- No behavior changes in send/webhook yet; just declare truth.

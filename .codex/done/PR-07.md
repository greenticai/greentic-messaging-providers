# PR-07: Recreate Adaptive Card downscaling parity fixtures (shared) + provider golden tests

## Goal
Make parity measurable. Create shared fixtures representing the “classic” adaptive cards and ensure encoding stays stable.

## Changes
- Add a shared fixtures directory:
  - `tests/fixtures/render_plans/` (RenderPlan JSON)
  - `tests/fixtures/expected_payloads/<provider>/` (expected ProviderPayload JSON)
- Add golden tests per provider:
  - load fixture RenderPlan
  - call encode
  - compare JSON snapshot

## Acceptance criteria
- Fixtures cover at least the top 5 “most important” cards you used before
- Golden tests run in CI for all providers
- CI stays green

## Notes
- These fixtures become your contract with enterprise customers.

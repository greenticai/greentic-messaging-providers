# PR-06: Implement Tier A/B encoding for providers that support native cards

## Goal
Restore parity for providers that previously supported richer card experiences by mapping Tier A/B plans to platform-native payloads.

## Changes
- For providers with native card support (likely Teams/Webchat/Slack depending on your previous implementation):
  - Implement Tier A mapping in `encode`
  - Implement Tier B (reduced card) mapping
- Providers that do NOT support cards keep Tier D
- Add golden fixture tests:
  - input: RenderPlan Tier A/B
  - expected: provider payload JSON snapshot

## Acceptance criteria
- At least 1 provider fully supports Tier A+B
- Tests prove stable payload mapping
- No provider-specific logic added to host; all mapping is inside provider

## Notes
- Keep these mappings purely mechanical: plan → payload, no extra business logic.
